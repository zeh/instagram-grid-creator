After a lull 2020 (7 books), 2021 (6), and a useless 2022 (0!), it feels good to be back on track with a consistent number of books finished.

I never really stopped reading, but sometimes I get into a routine where it goes very slowly, or where I get stuck with huge, tough books to read. I'm learning to pace myself with more easy reading (mostly fiction) along the way!
